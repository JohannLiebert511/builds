# Optimized libraries

Since Host OS focus is on virtualization, you might want some
additional packages that are not provided by this project, for
example, optimized libraries to take advantage of hardware functions
or a more recent toolchain.

In this case, you might want to you install the Advance Toolchain for
Linux on Power (AT). To install AT on top of Host OS or CentOS 7,
follow the instructions for RHEL 7 [here](https://github.com/advancetoolchain/advance-toolchain/wiki#yum).
