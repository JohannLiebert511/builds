+=head1 OUTPUT TO GLANCE
+
+To output to OpenStack Glance, use the I<-o glance> option.
+
+This runs the L<glance(1)> CLI program which must be installed on the
+virt-v2v conversion host.  For authentication to work, you will need
+to set C<OS_*> environment variables.  In most cases you can do this
+by sourcing a file called something like F<keystonerc_admin>.
+
+Virt-v2v adds metadata for the guest to Glance, describing such things
+as the guest operating system and what drivers it requires.  The
+command C<glance image-show> will display the metadata as "Property"
+fields such as C<os_type> and C<hw_disk_bus>.
+
+=head2 Glance and sparseness
+
+Glance image upload doesn't appear to correctly handle sparseness.
+For this reason, using qcow2 will be faster and use less space on the
+Glance server.  Use the virt-v2v S<I<-of qcow2>> option.
